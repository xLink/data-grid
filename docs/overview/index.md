Cartalyst's Data Grid package makes it easy for you to filter data sources. Data Grid shifts the focus from pagination to data filtration. Pass any data source through a data handler and the package will take care of the rest so you can use the filtered result set to create your applications.

We emphasize filtering first, sorting second, and lastly, paginating those results.
